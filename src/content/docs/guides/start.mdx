Welcome to the high seas. It matters not what you're here for or where you came from - whether you're here cause something's blocked and unobtainable, or you're simply trying to cut costs, we're here to help. This wiki is meant to be the be-all, end-all of piracy wikis. We strive to make simple yet informative guides and references to give you the full knowledge of the pirate world, without any of the extraneous parts.

To start off, [you'll most likely want to torrent,](/guides/torrent) as this is the most common way to get movies and shows. You may also [want to use a streaming service/app,](/guides/stream) or you can [directly download videos](/guides/ddl-video) if you prefer that. If you don't mind getting down to the weeds, [the usenet can be very good,](/guides/usenet) especially for more obscure content.

For software, [we have a guide](/guides/ddl-soft) for downloading, installing, and testing them. We also have [one for modern gamers](/guides/ddl-games) and [for old-school gamers.](/guides/emulation)

Prefer to read instead? We have [one for regular books/audiobooks](/guides/books) and [one for manga/comics.](/guides/manga)
